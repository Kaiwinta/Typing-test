The Objective is to have a tkinter interface with a menu and an Second Page
I already did a functionnal version but i want a proper interface 

Menu :
    The creator
    The title of the project
    The access to the second page

Second Page:
    A text Generator 
    Saving the result into a .txt files

The savong actually dont works but it will come soon
